I am creating web 3 search engine designed specifically for the decentralized internet, or Web3. Unlike traditional search engines that index
content from the centralized Web2, Web3  focuses on retrieving information from decentralized sources, such as blockchain-hosted websites andIPFS 
(InterPlanetary File System). This platform aims to facilitate direct interactions between users and services without intermediaries, ensuring 
privacy and decentralization.
